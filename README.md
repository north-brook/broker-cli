# broker-cli

Give your AI agent a brokerage account.

Broker APIs exist. SDKs exist. But AI agents use the command line. **broker-cli** turns any brokerage into shell commands your agent already understands, with a `SKILL.md` that teaches it everything.

📖 **[brokercli.com](https://brokercli.com)** · 📚 **[Reference](https://brokercli.com/reference)**

## Install

```bash
curl -fsSL https://brokercli.com/install | bash
```

Or via pip:

```bash
pip install broker-cli
```

## Quick Start

```bash
broker daemon start --paper   # Start in paper trading mode
broker daemon status           # Check connection
broker quote AAPL MSFT         # Get quotes
broker positions               # View portfolio
broker exposure --by symbol    # Exposure analysis
broker order buy AAPL 100 --limit 185   # Place an order
```

## Built for Agents

- **SKILL.md Included** — Ships with a skill file that Codex, Claude Code, and OpenClaw agents read automatically. Your agent knows every command, flag, and workflow without extra prompting.
- **CLI-First, Agent-Ready** — Every action is a shell command. Agents don't need SDKs, API keys, or custom integrations — just bash.
- **Autonomous Execution** — Persistent auth keeps sessions alive 24/7. No manual logins, no token expiry interruptions.
- **Multi-Broker** — Unified commands across E\*Trade and Interactive Brokers. One skill file, one interface.
- **Full Options Support** — Option chains with greeks, expiry filtering, and strike ranges.
- **Risk Guardrails** — Exposure analysis, cancel-all for instant flattening, paper trading mode. Power with built-in safety valves.

## E\*Trade Setup

```bash
broker auth etrade
```

### Persistent Auth (Headless)

Keep E\*Trade authenticated across the daily midnight token expiry:

```json
{
  "broker": {
    "provider": "etrade",
    "etrade": {
      "consumer_key": "...",
      "consumer_secret": "...",
      "username": "your_username",
      "password": "your_password",
      "persistent_auth": true
    }
  }
}
```

Or via environment variables:

```bash
export BROKER_ETRADE_USERNAME=your_username
export BROKER_ETRADE_PASSWORD=your_password
export BROKER_ETRADE_PERSISTENT_AUTH=true
```

Requires Playwright: `pip install playwright && playwright install chromium`

> Accounts with 2FA/MFA enabled cannot use persistent auth. Use `broker auth etrade` for manual authentication.
