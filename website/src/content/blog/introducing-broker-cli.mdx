AI coding agents — Codex, Claude Code, OpenClaw — interact with the world through shell commands. They can `git push`, run tests, deploy apps. But they can't trade.

Broker APIs exist. SDKs exist. But agents don't use HTTP clients or OAuth flows well. They use **bash**.

**broker-cli** closes that gap.

## What it does

Install broker-cli, and your agent gets a full trading interface through the terminal:

```bash
broker quote AAPL MSFT          # Get quotes
broker positions                # View portfolio
broker exposure --by symbol     # Analyze risk
broker order buy AAPL 100       # Place orders
broker chain AAPL --type call   # Option chains with greeks
broker cancel --all             # Cancel everything
```

Every command outputs JSON. Every action is deterministic. No SDKs, no API keys to manage, no custom integrations — just shell commands.

## The SKILL.md advantage

broker-cli ships with a `SKILL.md` file that agents read automatically. This means your agent knows every command, flag, and workflow without extra prompting. Point it at a task, and it figures out which commands to run:

```
$ codex exec "Check my portfolio. If any position exceeds 20% of NLV, trim it to 15%."

agent → reading SKILL.md...
agent → broker exposure --by symbol --json
agent → TSLA is 34.2% of NLV. Reducing to 15%.
agent → broker order sell TSLA 142 --limit 248.50
✓ Order placed. TSLA exposure now 15.1% of NLV.
```

## Multi-broker, one interface

broker-cli currently supports **Interactive Brokers** and **E\*Trade**, with a unified command interface across both. Your agent doesn't need to know which broker is behind the scenes — the commands are the same.

| Feature | Interactive Brokers | E\*Trade |
|---|:---:|:---:|
| Real-time quotes | ✅ | ✅ |
| Option chains + greeks | ✅ | ✅ |
| All order types | ✅ | ✅ |
| Exposure analysis | ✅ | ✅ |
| Persistent auth | — | ✅ |
| Streaming events | ✅ | — |

## Safety first

We built broker-cli with guardrails:

- **Paper trading mode** — `broker daemon start --paper` for risk-free testing
- **Pre-trade risk checks** — `broker risk check` validates orders before submission
- **Exposure analysis** — real-time breakdown by symbol, sector, or asset class
- **Emergency halt** — `broker risk halt` cancels everything and blocks new orders
- **Cancel all** — instant position flattening when needed

## Get started

```bash
curl -fsSL https://brokercli.com/install | bash

broker-cli is open source. Check out the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/north-brook/broker-cli), read the [full reference](https://brokercli.com/reference), and give your agent a brokerage account.
